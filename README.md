# Reverse N-Number Crown Pattern Generator

This repository contains a C++ program that generates a Reverse N-Number Crown pattern for a given integer 'N'.

## Problem Statement

Given 'N', the program prints the corresponding pattern. The pattern consists of numbers increasing from 1 to `n` on the left side and decreasing from `n` to 1 on the right side. The number in the middle of the last row is repeated.

## Constraints

1 <= N <= 20

## Usage

Compile the program with a C++ compiler (g++ 11 or later recommended). Run the program and enter an integer 'N' when prompted.

## Example

Input: `N` = 3

Output:
